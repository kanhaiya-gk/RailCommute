# RailCommute - Railway Management System
## About
+ This is a Team Project under Prof Dr Amrita Chaturvedi wherein we developed an Android application with Django Framework as a server for handling database operations.
+ This project includes services such as train availability between stations, ticket booking/cancellation, ticket history, and
